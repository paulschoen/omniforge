## Greetings, Servant of the Machine God

Your new Nx workspace has been consecrated and awaits your command. This repository is a fan creation and bears no affiliation with Games Workshop.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/nx-api/node?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or execute `npx nx graph` to examine the constructs created. Now, let us proceed with your indoctrination into the high mysteries of code!

## Complete Your CI Rites

[Click here to complete the sacred rites for configuring your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/6TIRnMBwcS)

## Execute Tasks

To initiate the development server for your application, perform the following rite:

```sh
npx nx serve omniforge
```

To forge a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build omniforge
```

To reveal all available targets to execute for a project, invoke:

```sh
npx nx show project omniforge
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or explicitly defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` tomes.

## Forge New Projects

Whilst new projects can be added manually, it is more efficient to utilize [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) capabilities.

To generate a new application, use the following incantation:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:app demo
```

To generate a new library, invoke:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/node:lib mylib
```

Invoke `npx nx list` to obtain a catalog of installed plugins. Then, execute `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about the specific functionalities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators within your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

The Nx Console is an extension that enriches your coding rituals. It allows you to execute tasks, generate code, and enhance autocompletion within your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
